## Background and Overview

Food waste is an issue pervasive to urban and rural environments alike. In the United States alone, food waste accounts for an estimated 30-40% of food supply. It's common for consumers to purchase more food than they ultimately consume. Forgotten food generally finds its way to the back of the fridge, where it sits until it spoils.

PCNK provides a simple, user-facing tool for those with extra food to give it away to a someone from a known personal network, whether a coworker or friend. Users can take a photo of the food they want to give away and upload it to PCNK with a brief description. The uploader can choose to share the item with a specific group, e.g. coworkers, or a larger network. Users with access to the uploaded item may view it in their "pantry," which displays food currently available to claim.

PCNK's target audience is groups of people who devote significant time within shared locations (e.g. housemates, offices, gym-members, church-goers, etc.)

Users can:
  * Upload images of food to share
  * Claim food they see in a scrollable "pantry"
  * Grant specific groups access to foods they upload
